## Drum Kit Project

This is a simple web-based drum kit built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play a variety of drum sounds using their keyboard or by clicking on the on-screen drum pads.

### Files:

* **index.html:** Contains the basic HTML structure of the drum kit, including the buttons representing different drum sounds.
* **styles.css:** Provides the styling for the drum kit, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **script.js:**  Contains the JavaScript code that handles user interaction and plays the corresponding sounds. 

### How it Works:

1. **HTML Structure:** The HTML file sets up the layout of the drum kit using buttons, each representing a different drum sound. 

2. **CSS Styling:** The CSS file styles the buttons to resemble a real drum kit, enhancing the user interface.

3. **JavaScript Interaction:** 
   * The JavaScript code listens for key presses and mouse clicks on the drum buttons.
   * When a key is pressed or a button is clicked, the JavaScript code identifies the corresponding drum sound.
   * The corresponding audio file for the selected drum sound is played.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:  `git clone https://github.com/your-username/drum-kit.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click on the drum pads or use your keyboard to play the drum sounds. The following keys are mapped to different sounds:
    * **w** -  Tom 1
    * **a** -  Tom 2
    * **s** -  Tom 3
    * **d** -  Tom 4
    * **j** -  Snare
    * **k** -  Crash
    * **l** -  Kick

### Features:

* Interactive drum kit interface.
* Keyboard and mouse control for playing sounds.
